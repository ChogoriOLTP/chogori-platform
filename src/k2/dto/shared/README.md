Header files in the dto/shared directory are used by both core chogori-platform binaries (e.g. nodepool, CPO, etc) and by header-only libraries that are part of chogori-platform but are compiled as part of a project that includes them. Files in this shared directory should all include "Shared.h" which will conditionally redefine macros in the file for compatibility.

Consumers of these header files outside of the platform project will need the nlohmann JSON library. Headers other than SKVRecord.h can be consumed directly (their implementation is included as part of the header). Methods of SKVRecord.h must be implemented by the consumer as needed (most likely only serialization and deserialization functions). The consumer also needs to define SKVStorage by including SKVRecord.h
